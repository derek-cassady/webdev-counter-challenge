1. Why do you use "using strict" at the top of your JS files?
A1. You can use "using strict" either globally or locally.  It deos a lot of things,
it forces you to declare variables properly, gives better errors, keeps code from being
introduced, doesn't allow duplicates and using old features that are no longer available.

2. What does line 3 mean?
A2. You are assinging the variable 'count' the number '0' when the script runs.

3. What is happening on lines 5-8 and why?
A3. You're using the 'document.querySelector' to grab elements from the DOM and
assigning them to a constant variable.

4. If you implemented the functionality of the buttons,
   why do you think I wrote the JS code the way I did?
A4. You are applying "using strict" globally, assinging your beginning
count with 'let', you're using that globally instead of 'var'. 'var' can
be assigned again, but 'let' can't.  Since you're using that globally, it's
better. Using the 'querySelector' lets you pull the class directly from the
DOM, ensuring fewer mistakes, and just easier way of assigning your constants.
You seperated your functions for each button and then followed with the event
listeners for each button.  I am honestly not sure if the function has to
come before the listener, but it makes logical since in the order that they will
operate and makes the code easier to follow if things are grouped in a logical
fashion.
